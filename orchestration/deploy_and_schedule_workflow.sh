# This script will deploy a workflow to run bulk_fhir_fetch along with a
# cloud scheduler that will trigger it periodically with the variables listed
# below. You must update the variables below to match your configuration.
#
# Once this script is run to install the workflow and scheduler with some
# set of variables, you can always trigger a one-off run of the scheduled
# workflow using the below command or via the GCP UI.
# gcloud scheduler jobs run ${SCHEDULER_NAME} --location=${LOCATION}

# ============================================================================ #
# Please update each of the below variables to configure the scheduled workflow
# run.

# Workflow and scheduler config
WORKFLOW_NAME="bulk-fetch-custom"
SCHEDULER_NAME="bulk-fetch-custom-scheduler"
SCHEDULE_CRON='0 22 * * 1-5'
# This is the service account email to be used to generate an OAuth token sent
# by the scheduler to the batch jobs service when triggering batch jobs. The
# caller of this script must have the iam.serviceAccounts.actAs (see
# https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts#user-role) for this
# service account.
# By default you can use the default compute engine service account, which looks
# like $PROJECT_NUMERIC_ID-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com but you may
# wish to create a dedicated service account for this job as well.
# Please update this value to the service account you would like to use.

# GCloud Commands:

# Deploy the workflow:
gcloud workflows deploy ${WORKFLOW_NAME} --source="bulk_fetch_workflow.yaml" --location=${LOCATION}

# Setup a scheduler to trigger the workflow based on the $SCHEDULE_CRON
# variable. You can force a one-off run/trigger of this job (once it is created)
# at any time using the below. Useful for testing.
# gcloud scheduler jobs run ${SCHEDULER_NAME} --location=${LOCATION}
#
# After running this script for the first time, you must delete the old
# scheduler to replace it with a new one. To do so, uncomment the line below or
# delete the scheduler in the GCP UI.
# gcloud scheduler jobs delete http ${SCHEDULER_NAME}
